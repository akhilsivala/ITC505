                <p>
                    In my JavaScript project, I addressed the challenge of
                    sorting an array of integers input by the user, opting for a
                    bubble sort algorithm due to its simplicity and
                    instructional value. The process began with capturing the
                    user's comma-separated numbers as a string, which I then
                    converted into an integer array. This conversion was pivotal
                    for the sorting logic, ensuring the algorithm treated the
                    inputs as numbers rather than strings. Implementing this
                    feature involved parsing the input string into an array and
                    using parseInt to convert each element to an integer,
                    preparing it for sorting.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The primary hurdle I faced was the accurate conversion of
                    user input into an integer array, necessitating a method to
                    handle potential non-numeric inputs effectively. Another
                    challenge was the bubble sort algorithm itself, chosen for
                    its educational merit despite its inefficiency for large
                    datasets. Ensuring accurate iterations and swaps within the
                    algorithm required meticulous attention to loop conditions.
                    These challenges were surmounted by focusing on fundamental
                    JavaScript techniques, offering a valuable learning
                    experience in managing user input and algorithm
                    implementation in a web environment.
